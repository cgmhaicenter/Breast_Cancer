The codes are not intened for clinical use. The codes are developed for screening breast cancer on mammography. On data preprocessing, we use mammography reports for labeling our images. The mammography images could be investigated by some categories. About screening breast cancer, we apply the records of breast cancer and BI-RADS category for screening images of breast cancer or lesion. About screening breast composition, or breast density, the records from the reports used for image classification.
